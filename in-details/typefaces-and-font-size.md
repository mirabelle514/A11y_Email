# Typefaces & Font Size

### Context with A11y:

* Selecting a typeface that is clear and easy to read, avoiding overly decorative fonts that can be difficult to decipher. For font size, ensure it is large enough (typically at least `12px`) to be easily readable on all devices, including for users with visual impairments.&#x20;

### Guidelines for Typefaces & Font Size:

* Set your font size between 12 and 16 points.&#x20;
* Use a simple, email-safe, readable font for emails.&#x20;
* DO NOT use underlines in electronic communications unless the text is a link.
* Align text to the left.



### How to choose what Typefaces & Font Size to use:&#x20;

* Use EML if your email is being built for Raven, Comms-Hub, or as a React template. Our[ text component ](https://experience.indeed.design/components/email/text)and [typography](https://experience.indeed.design/components/email/typography) already follow all accessibility rules.&#x20;
* But if you cannot use EML, eight typefaces are email-safe for all email provider services today: `Arial` | `Helvetica` | `Times New Roman` | `Georgia` | `Tahoma` | `Verdana` | `Courier New` or `Trebuchet MS`.&#x20;
* Your chosen email typeface should be no less than `12 px` and no greater than `16 px.` A very large font size dominates email content and may appear distorted or out of place in some email provider platforms.
* If your message typeface is too small, your clients or prospective customers typically skip reading it. This can create problems, especially in transaction emails.



### EML already covers this for you:&#x20;

At this time, all emails and EDL patterns are currently using an Indeed Sans first approach. Patterns are designed with Indeed Sans to align with the Indeed Design System, and emails are developed to use Indeed Sans when available.  In many email clients, due to a lack of Web font support, emails will fall back to Helvetica Neue. Font sizing, line heights, and colors should remain consistent between the two typefaces.

With this in mind, we created a [Text component.](https://experience.indeed.design/components/email/text) That text component accounts for all IDS guidelines & accessibility best practices. You should also read the Experience Hub page on our [Typography](https://experience.indeed.design/components/email/typography).&#x20;
