# Do and Don't

### DO

* Set your font size between 12 and 16 points.
* Consider increasing the spacing between lines to improve readability. This is particularly important for eye tracking and can reduce eye fatigue.
* Line height (line spacing) should be at least 1.5 times the font size.&#x20;
* The spacing following paragraphs should at least be two times the font size.
* If something is essential, adding "Important" or "Note" ensures that all users know it has been emphasized.
* Take time to send yourself test emails to ensure quality and readability before sending them to a group.&#x20;
* Use real bullets and numbered lists.
* Link text should give readers an idea of where they will go when they engage a link.&#x20;
* Keep your actual CTA copy between 1 and 5 words.

### DON'T

* **Do not underline text that is not a link** to avoid confusing users. Underline only hyperlinks to make them easy to identify.
* **Avoid images with text.** If the image is necessary, repeat all the text included in the image as part of the email.&#x20;
* **Do not use color alone to convey important information.** Use text or icons in addition to color to make the message clear to everyone.
* On white backgrounds, avoid low-contrast colors (no yellow!!)
* Avoid using all caps because screen readers might read all caps as individual letters.&#x20;
* Avoid animation, but if you must use a GIF, your animation should stop after 5 seconds and should not contain blinking/flashing content.
* **Avoid using only visual cues like italics to relay information,** as they may not be perceivable to all users. Use other methods like headings.
