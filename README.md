# A11y In Email

{% hint style="info" %}
**Have you ever wondered why we say A11y?** \
This is because there are 11 letters between A and Y in the word accessibility. We call this a numeronym. Isn't this fun?!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Overview

Accessibility is the practice of making things meaningful and easy to use for people of all physical and cognitive abilities. The goal is to let as many people as possible access a resource. That could include a building, a restroom, an event or activity, a website, an application, or an email.

Email accessibility is the practice of writing, designing, and coding HTML emails so people can easily understand and engage with them regardless of physical or mental constraints. This includes optimizing emails for people who use assistive technology to access the Internet and their email inboxes.



> The most well-known and comprehensive law connected to accessibility in the U.S. is the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/). This legislation protects the rights of individuals with disabilities, and it has been the basis for many lawsuits in which businesses are sued for failing to provide accessible experiences.
>
> While the ADA has no direct technical guidance on digital accessibility, the group responsible for providing global guidelines in this area is the Worldwide Web Consortium ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/)), which publishes the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)).

### Why follow accessibility guidelines?&#x20;

*   **Accessible design improves usability for **_**everyone**_** on your list.**

    Because human-centered design is at the core of accessibility, the changes you make — from color contrast to font sizes — will benefit every person on your list. They’ll all enjoy a fuller, richer inbox experience, which ultimately increases your return on investing in email accessibility.



*   #### **Accessible emails improve engagement and retention.**

    If subscribers can’t read your email content or interact with your calls to action (CTAs), they can’t engage with your emails. They also won’t likely stick around for future emails, either.&#x20;

*   #### Following accessibility best practices minimizes legal risk.

    The number of website accessibility lawsuits filed in 2022 [increased by 12%](https://www.adatitleiii.com/2023/01/plaintiffs-set-a-new-record-for-website-accessibility-lawsuit-filings-in-2022/) from the previous year.  And there were likely many more unreported state lawsuits and demand letters with out-of-court settlements. Litigation is a serious threat to any company that does not meet the needs of its entire audience. Plus, customers' opinions of your brand are diminished when they hear about these cases.



*   #### Accessibility enhances your brand.

    By making your emails accessible, you’re speaking directly to everyone's needs and showing that you care. Thinking about subscribers as people rather than just contacts in a database shows that you care about them and put their needs first. The [Association of National Advertisers](https://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/ii-2021-12-empathy-marketing) (ANA) cites a study that found **92% of consumers want brands to practice empathy**. That means creating accessible emails that show you understand how people with both temporary and permanent impairments engage with your brand.
