# Types of disabilities to consider

### 1. Vision impairments&#x20;

Summary: Vision disabilities go far beyond blindness or low vision. They also include color blindness and those sensitive to brightness, cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy.  Vision impairments are the most likely way a subscriber would have trouble accessing an HTML email. For example, astigmatism is a condition that can make it hard to read emails in dark mode.&#x20;

Solution: Consider using an appropriate [color contrast](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-marketing/color-contrast-accessibility-tips/) in your emails, a readable font/font size, and coding emails so they are compatible with screen reading software.

### 2. Auditory impairments

Summary: Auditory disabilities include those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Someone with an auditory disability might have trouble with sound volume, frequency of sound, or phantom noises (called tinnitus).&#x20;

Solution: Consider things like video captions and podcast transcripts in your emails.

### 3. Cognitive issues

Summary: People with mental limitations that affect memory, problem-solving, attention, or comprehension. For example, dyslexia is a common cognitive issue that can impact the ability to engage with an email.

Solution: When building emails, use a simple layout and presentation, avoid technical language, include clear instructions when necessary, and steer clear of distracting animation.

### 4. Neurological conditions

Summary: People with conditions that affect the central and peripheral nervous system — brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves, etc. This includes things like strokes, epilepsy, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and brain tumors. ADD and ADHD are also neurological disorders that may impact how subscribers engage with email campaigns.

Solution: Make sure your email is easy to navigate, break up text into smaller sections, and avoid precise actions that would be difficult for someone with tremors or using a mouth stick.

### 5. Physical limitations

Summary: Physical disabilities include those with weaknesses or limitations of motor control. It may also involve problems like tremors, lack of coordination, paralysis, joint disorders such as arthritis, and missing limbs.

Solution: Ensure your email can be easily accessed with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

### 6. Speech impairments

Summary: This includes people who cannot produce speech that is recognizable by others or by software. Muteness and stuttering are just two examples here. Include options in your email to get in touch beyond a phone call, like a contact form, live chat box, or a reply-to email address.

Solution: Accessibility is another reason to [stop using a no-reply](https://www.mailjet.com/blog/deliverability/noreply-email-address/) from the address in your campaigns.

### 7. Temporary impairments and environmental considerations

Summary: This includes many factors that temporarily make it difficult for people to consume your emails: broken arms, missing glasses, slow internet speeds, using a mobile phone in the sun, watching video without sound in a public space, or even using Alexa or Siri.

Solution: Remember, the same people who easily consume your content now might have eye surgery or carpal tunnel in a few weeks.
